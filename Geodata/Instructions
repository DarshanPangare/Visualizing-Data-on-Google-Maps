Download the code and edit where.data to add an address you wish to visualize.
Then run the geoload.py to lookup all of the entries in where.data (including the new one) and produce the geodata.sqlite. 
Then run geodump.py to read the database and produce where.js. 
Then open where.html to visualize the map.
